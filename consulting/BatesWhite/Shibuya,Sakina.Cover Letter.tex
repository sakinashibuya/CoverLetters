Dear Hiring Committee Members,

I am writing to express my interest in the \posName \vspace{1mm} position at \compName. 
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, specializing in applied microeconomics, 
with expertise in empirical methods and economic analysis. My experience in analyzing complex data, conducting rigorous quantitative research, 
and leading team-oriented projects aligns closely with the requirements for this role, and I am excited by the opportunity to contribute 
to \compName's work in economic consulting.

My job market paper, “Effects of Military Bases on Women in Colombia,” exemplifies my analytical approach and my commitment to 
applying economic insights to real-world challenges. Using an event-study methodology, I examine the causal impacts of military base presence 
on social issues such as sexual violence, fertility, and family structure, leveraging temporal and geographical variations to establish causality. 
This project has provided me with extensive experience in data management, model building, and regression analysis in Stata, as well as skills 
in communicating complex findings to policymakers and stakeholders. I am confident that my experience designing and managing empirical research projects 
will allow me to contribute meaningfully to \compName's litigation support and economic analysis services.

In addition to my research, I have developed strong mentorship and leadership skills, supervising junior researchers and leading training sessions 
in applied econometrics, program evaluation, and statistical coding. I have also presented my findings to diverse audiences, ensuring clarity and accuracy 
in complex economic analyses. These experiences have equipped me with the communication and teamwork skills needed to effectively support 
\compName's interdisciplinary project teams and client relations.

I am particularly drawn to the opportunity at \compName \vspace{1mm} due to its focus on providing rigorous economic insights that inform high-stakes decision-making in 
sectors ranging from public policy to labor and employment. 
I am excited about the prospect of working alongside other experts in economics, policy, and law and 
contributing to \compName's consulting activities.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background in economics, quantitative analysis, and 
leadership can contribute to \compName. Please feel free to contact me by telephone at +1 (917) 969-5420 or by email at sshibuya2@wisc.edu.
