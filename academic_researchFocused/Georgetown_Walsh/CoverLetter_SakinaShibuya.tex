Dear Hiring Committee Members,

I am writing to apply for the position of the Assistant Professor 
at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service. 
I am an applied microeconomist who integrates rigorous empirical methods to address pressing issues related to gender, conflict, and economic development.
I will complete my Ph.D. in Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in May 2025. 
%I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to join your faculty as an Assistant Professor. Given that my partner and I currently live in East Tennessee, 
%I am particularly excited about the prospect of making a long-term contribution to both the university and the local community.

My job market paper, “Effects of Military Bases on Women in Colombia,” co-authored with Felipe Parra, investigates the causal impacts of military base presence 
on sexual violence, fertility, and child support disputes in rural Colombia. Using a novel dataset constructed from various sources and employing an event-study approach, 
we leverage the temporal and geographical variation in military base placements driven by Colombia's military expansion from 2000 to 2016. This allows us to identify 
the causal effects of military interventions, revealing a 72\% increase in registered cases of sexual violence over 15 years. 
This research contributes to understanding the unintended consequences of state security interventions and provides critical insights 
for policymakers working in conflict-affected settings.

My interest in conflict extends to examining how violence disrupts economic production by altering individuals' beliefs about safety. 
In the third chapter of my dissertation, ``Watch Your Step: The Impact of Landmines on Rural Households During Conflict,'' co-authored with Felipe Parra, 
we analyze how landmine explosions in Colombia affect rural households' economic activities by changing their perceptions of mobility and safety. 
Using quasi-exogenous variation in landmine explosions as signals of security threat, we estimate the impact of landmines on agricultural production. 
This research highlights the critical link between security concerns and economic outcomes in conflict-affected areas.


In the coming years, I will expand my research on gender disparities and conflict in developing economies. 
In Colombia, I will investigate the broader social impacts of military interventions, including effects on reproductive rights and educational outcomes. 
I plan to leverage my research fundraising experience from my Ph.D. training to secure funding from diverse public, private, and non-profit sources, 
using these resources to support research assistants on my projects.

Thank you for considering my application. 
I can be reached by telephone at +1 (917) 969-5420, and by email at sshibuya2@wisc.edu.
