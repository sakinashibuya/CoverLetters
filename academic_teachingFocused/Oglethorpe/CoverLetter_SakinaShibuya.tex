Dear Hiring Committee Members,

I am writing to apply for the Assistant Professor of Economics position at the Hammack School of Business at Oglethorpe University. 
I am an applied microeconomist who integrates rigorous empirical methods to address pressing issues related to gender, conflict, and economic development.
I will complete my Ph.D. in Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in May 2025. 
%I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to join your faculty as an Assistant Professor. Given that my partner and I currently live in East Tennessee, 
%I am particularly excited about the prospect of making a long-term contribution to both the university and the local community.

My job market paper, “Effects of Military Bases on Women in Colombia,” co-authored with Felipe Parra, investigates the causal impacts of military base presence 
on sexual violence, fertility, and child support disputes in rural Colombia. Using a novel dataset constructed from various sources and employing an event-study approach, 
we leverage the temporal and geographical variation in military base placements driven by Colombia's military expansion from 2000 to 2016. This allows us to identify 
the causal effects of military interventions, revealing a 72\% increase in registered cases of sexual violence over 16 years. 
This research contributes to understanding the unintended consequences of state security interventions and provides critical insights 
for policymakers working in conflict-affected settings.

My teaching philosophy emphasizes inclusivity and accessibility, ensuring that economics resonates with diverse student backgrounds. 
As a teaching assistant for “Introduction to Statistical Methods for Public Policy Analysis” at the La Follette School of Public Policy, 
I developed and adapted teaching materials to accommodate students with varying levels of statistical proficiency. 
I focus on intuitive explanations, multiple presentation methods, and real-world examples to engage students, an approach that has been well-received 
in my student evaluations. Beyond the classroom, I have led training sessions for diverse groups, including development practitioners and policymakers, 
and adapted to various learning environments, from summer schools in Rwanda to training at the World Bank.

Mentorship is central to my commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion. I have actively mentored female Japanese students pursuing Ph.D. degrees, 
as well as supported students from African countries through the graduate application process as a mentor in the Graduate Applications International Network (GAIN). 
These experiences have shown me the transformative impact of providing guidance and support to underrepresented students in achieving their academic and 
professional aspirations.

Thank you for considering my application. 
%%Professor Ross Milton at the University of Wisconsin, Madison can promptly provide a teaching recommendation if needed.
I can be reached by telephone at +1 (917) 969-5420, and by email at sshibuya2@wisc.edu.
