Dear Hiring Committee Members,

I am writing to express my interest in the Economist (Gender and Youth Measurement) position at the Department for Outcomes of the World Bank. 
With a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Applied Economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and extensive experience in development economics, 
I specialize in analyzing gender disparities and youth outcomes in developing economies. 
I am passionate about leveraging rigorous research and data-driven methodologies to inform policies that promote sustainable and inclusive development, 
aligning closely with the World Bank's mission.

My job market paper, “Effects of Military Bases on Women in Colombia,” employs a robust causal identification strategy to examine 
the unintended consequences of military interventions. Using an event-study approach, I identify the causal effects of military base presence on sexual violence, 
revealing a 72\% increase in cases over 16 years. This work highlights the importance of understanding the social impacts of development and security policies. 
Additionally, my project, “Understanding the Constraints in Hiring Women,” investigates how entrenched gender norms influence employers' decisions in Pakistan's 
garment sector. This research, supported by grants from the International Growth Centre (IGC) and Private Enterprise Development in Low-Income Countries, 
aims to develop scalable solutions to increase female labor force participation in challenging contexts.

I bring extensive experience in designing and conducting rigorous data collection, econometric analysis, and monitoring and evaluation frameworks 
for policy-focused research. My previous work at the World Bank involved training policymakers and development practitioners in program evaluation, 
enabling me to effectively communicate complex methodologies and findings to diverse stakeholders. These experiences have prepared me to support 
the World Bank in advancing methodologies to assess gender and youth outcomes and integrate these metrics into project design and implementation.

I am also committed to knowledge sharing and capacity building. My contributions to the IGC blog and policy briefs have made 
my research accessible to broader audiences, fostering relationships with policymakers. Furthermore, I have successfully led workshops and training sessions 
for government officials and project teams, enhancing their ability to use data-driven approaches in decision-making.

Thank you for considering my application.
I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the World Bank's efforts to develop and implement innovative metrics that improve youth and gender outcomes. 
I am confident that my expertise in development economics, strong analytical skills, and experience in policy engagement will allow me to support the World Bank 
in achieving its objectives.
Please feel free to contact me at sshibuya2@wisc.edu or +1 (917) 969-5420.
