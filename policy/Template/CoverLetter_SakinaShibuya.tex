Dear Hiring Committee Members,

I am writing to express my interest in the [Position] at the [Institution]. 
With a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Applied Economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and extensive experience 
in development economics, I focus on gender disparities and the impacts of conflict in developing economies. 
I am passionate about leveraging rigorous research to inform policies that foster inclusive development, 
aligning closely with [Institution]'s mission.

My job market paper, ``Effects of Military Bases on Women in Colombia,'' co-authored with Felipe Parra, employs 
a robust causal identification strategy to analyze the unintended consequences of military interventions. 
Using an event-study approach, we identify the causal effects of military base presence on sexual violence, finding 
a 72\% increase in cases over 15 years. This work provides critical insights into the broader social impacts of 
state security policies. In another project, ``Understanding the Constraints in Hiring Women,'' I investigate how gender 
norms influence employers' decisions in Pakistan's garment sector. My research aims to inform scalable solutions that 
promote female labor force participation.

I am deeply committed to translating complex research into actionable insights for policymakers and broader audiences. 
I have contributed to the IGC blog and policy briefs and mentored underrepresented groups in economics, such as through 
the Graduate Applications International Network (GAIN), where I guided students from Africa through the graduate admission 
process. I have also mentored female Japanese students pursuing Ph.D. degrees, supporting their academic and professional 
growth. My commitment to diversity and inclusion is evident in my teaching, where I strive to create a welcoming and 
inclusive environment for all students.

I am drawn to [Institution]'s dedication to evidence-based research and policy engagement. I am confident that my expertise 
in development economics, combined with my leadership in research and mentorship, will allow me to contribute effectively 
to [Institution]'s work in global health, sustainable development finance, and beyond.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to [Institution]'s 
impactful research and policy efforts.
