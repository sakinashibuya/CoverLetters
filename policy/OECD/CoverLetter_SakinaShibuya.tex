Dear Mr. Miranda and Hiring Committee Members,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Junior Economist position within the Economics Department at Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 
With a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Applied Economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a strong foundation in microeconomics, development economics, and applied econometrics, 
I am eager to contribute to OECD's mission of informing policies that promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth among member countries.

My job market paper, “Effects of Military Bases on Women in Colombia,” investigates the social impacts of military interventions on host communities, 
specifically focusing on gender-based violence. This research uses an event-study methodology to assess how the arrival of military bases leads to 
a 72\% increase in cases of sexual violence over 16 years. The findings provide essential insights into the unintended social costs of defense policies, offering evidence that could support policy frameworks aimed at mitigating these effects. 
Additionally, my work on gender norms and hiring practices in Pakistan's garment sector highlights the complex ways in which entrenched norms influence labor market dynamics, with implications for fostering inclusive economic policies.

The OECD's commitment to data-driven policy and international collaboration resonates deeply with my career aspirations. 
My background includes training policymakers and practitioners in policy evaluation during my tenure with the World Bank, 
equipping me to bridge the gap between technical research and policy relevance. I have also contributed to policy outreach 
through publications with the International Growth Centre, where I translated complex research into actionable insights for broader audiences.

I am particularly drawn to OECD’s diverse, collaborative, and innovative environment and am confident that my skills in analytical thinking, 
flexible problem-solving, and cross-cultural collaboration will be assets to the team. I look forward to contributing to the OECD's impactful research and policy efforts, 
specifically in areas such as public finance, productivity, and labor and social affairs.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the prospect of joining OECD and contributing to its work on pressing global economic issues.
