Dear Hiring Committee Members,

I am writing to express my interest in the \posName \hspace{1mm} position at the Economic Survey Research Center in the Research Department at the \instName. 
With a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Applied Economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and extensive experience 
in development economics, I focus on gender disparities and the impacts of conflict in developing economies. 
I am passionate about leveraging rigorous research to inform policies that foster inclusive development, 
aligning closely with the \instName's mission.

My job market paper, ``Effects of Military Bases on Women in Colombia,'' co-authored with Felipe Parra, employs 
a robust causal identification strategy to analyze the unintended consequences of military interventions. 
Using an event-study approach, we identify the causal effects of military base presence on sexual violence, finding 
a 72\% increase in cases over 16 years. This work provides critical insights into the broader social impacts of 
state security policies. In another project, ``Understanding the Constraints in Hiring Women,'' I investigate how entrenched gender 
norms influence employers' decisions in Pakistan's garment sector. 
My research aims to develop scalable solutions that can effectively increase female labor force participation.

I am deeply committed to translating complex research into actionable insights for policymakers and broader audiences. 
Through my contributions to the International Growth Centre (IGC) blog and policy briefs, I have made my research in Pakistan more accessible, 
fostering relationships with policymakers. Additionally, I have in-depth experience training policymakers and development practitioners 
in policy evaluation during my pre-doctoral career at the World Bank. This experience has taught me how to effectively communicate 
with policymakers from diverse backgrounds, with varying levels of interest, statistical knowledge, and economic literacy.

I am drawn to the \instName's dedication to evidence-based research and policy engagement. I am confident that my expertise 
in development economics, combined with my leadership in research and mentorship, will allow me to contribute effectively 
to the \instName's work in providing useful policy recommendations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the \instName's 
impactful research and policy efforts.
